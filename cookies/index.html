    <a><h1>the best chocolate chip cookies known to man</h1></a>
  <a href="../index.html">go back !</a>
  <br>
  <br><br><br>
  <p>WARNING!! There's a lot of dough, do not bake everything at once!!!<br>(or you can, but you'll need a really big baking sheet)</p>
  <a><h2>what you need</h2></a>
  <br>
  <p>
  1 cup of unsalted butter (UNSALTED BUTTER IS JUST BETTER!!) 
  <br><br>
  1 cup of sugar 
  <br><br>
  1 cup of packed brown sugar 
  <br><br>
  2 tsp of vanilla extract 
  <br><br>
  2 eggs 
  <br><br>
  3 cups of all-purpose flour 
  <br><br>
  1 tsp baking soda 
  <br><br>
  1/2 tsp baking powder 
  <br><br>
  1 tsp salt
  <br><br>
  2 cups of chocolate chips (just throw the whole bag in!!) 
  </p>
  <br>
  
  <a><h2> instructions!! </h2></a>
  <br>
  <p>
  preheat the oven to 375F
  <br><br>
  put some parchment paper on the counter
  <br><br>
  in a medium bowl, mix your flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt
  <br><br>
  in another bowl, mix your butter and sugar until theyre combined
  <br><br>
  then beat in your eggs and vanilla until its all mixed together
  <br><br>
  put it all into one bowl and mix it together
  <br><br>
  add the chocolate chips once the dough is all together and mix them in
  <br><br>
  make all your dough into balls and put them on a baking sheet with parchment paper on it
  <br>
  (i reccomend making each of the balls about 3 tbsp, or [INSERT GRAMS HERE])
  <br><br>
  throw it in the oven for 8-10 minutes, take them out when they're just <b>barely</b> turning brown
  <br>
  (they will not look done! but they are!!)
  <br><br>
  take it out and let it sit for a few minutes before moving them to a cooling rack or plate
  <br><br>
  wait about 15 minutes or so and now you can eat it !
  <br><br>
  if you try eating them before that then they'll be really hard to eat and they'll be falling apart and stuff, but yeah!!
  <br><br>
  to store it, put it in a bag and into the fridge, try to get all the oxygen out of the bag 
  <br>
  (i havent tested it but that's generally a good way to store perishable food, so do that)
